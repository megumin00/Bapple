# Bapple
shamelessly stolen via ffmpeg and pywhatkit

unable to upload to the mp4 directly so you'll have to somehow download a 60fps bad apple video \n
run it through ffmpeg and convert it into individual frames @ 60fps \n
convert it individual ascii files (not the most efficient, I know) \n
run the bash file \n
